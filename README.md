Concurrent programming and fundamental operating systems principles implemented
-----------------------
- Traffic sync: assignment on semaphores, threads, and deadlock. Regulate traffic on a two-way one-lane bridge.
- Dining philosophers: assignment on semaphores, and deadlock avoidance & detection.
- Dekker's algorithm: first mutual exclusion algorithm.
- Peterson's algorithm (coming later): simpler and more elegant than Dekker's.
