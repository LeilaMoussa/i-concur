Concurrent programming and fundamental operating systems principles implemented
-----------------------
- Traffic sync: assignment on semaphores, threads, and deadlock. Regulate traffic on a two-way one-lane bridge.

- Dekker's algorithm (coming later): personal interest in the mutual exclusion algorithm.
- Peterson's algorithm: simpler and more elegant than Dekker's.
